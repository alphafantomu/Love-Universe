# Love Engine Workspace
ROBLOX's OOP implemented into Love Engine

### Important
So in the making of this, the OOP part of the workspace works fine on the love engine, but having live updating interface of objects within the engine
while making the engine not lag was difficult (tried chaining functions and looping through them), probably because I either haven't figured out
how Love Engine works, or that I made some dumb mistake. This psuedo workspace is mostly for people to create their own objects similar to Roblox's
OOP, creating classes etc, rendering with workspace is a bit unreliable at the moment.
